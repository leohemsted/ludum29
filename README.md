OH GOD I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING


Timelone blog thought-dump thing

11:30: Start

12:30: Actually start

Under the sea. Control a diver (wsad?) and also control the boat (J + L?) Dodge things with both. Pick up treasure (predictably) with diver? Get it to the boat to score.

13:10: Actually actually start

As in real code written down. getting a simple game engine, draw a sprite on screen and wsad movement is next goal. Just diver, not boat or enemies or sea or anything yet
